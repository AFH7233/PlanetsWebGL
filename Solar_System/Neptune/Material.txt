Ni val
(Specifies the optical density for the surface. This is also known as index of refraction. The values can range from 0.001 to 10. A value of 1.0 means that light does not bend as it passes through an object. Increasing the optical_density increases the amount of bending. Glass has an index of refraction of about 1.5. Values of less than 1.0 produce bizarre results and are not recommended).

d val
(Specifies the dissolve for the current material. The value represents the amount this material dissolves into the background. A factor of 1.0 is fully opaque. This is the default when a new material is created. A factor of 0.0 is fully dissolved, i.e., completely transparent).

Tr val
Transmission Filter: Tf 1.0000 1.0000 1.0000 
(Any light passing through the object is filtered by the transmission filter, which only allows the specific colors to pass through. For example, Tf 0 1 0 allows all the green to pass through and filters out all the red and blue).
